                            <h2>The Problem </h2>
                            <p> While travel seems like an ideal way to enable people to understand different cultural perspectives, a vast proportion of tourists 
                                never truly step outside their cultural comfort zone to better understand the culture of their destination. People travel to expand their cultural horizons, but they 
                                often fail to accomplish this goal by failing to plan a culturally-inclusive itinerary. The most popular attractions are also the first that people find. Designing an itinerary 
                                that balances multiple aspects of cultural understanding (such as history, local life, arts, and interaction with locals) is difficult.Therefore, we created a product
                                for the travlers who aim to broaden their cultural horizons, but don't have the local resources necessary to find the ideal experiences
                                to accomplish this goal.

                            <h2>User Research </h2>
                            <p> We first conducted two semi-structured interviews with a product manager from Google Maps and a self-identified transgender person who has experienced discrimination whilte traveling.
                                During and ater each interview, we conducted thorough notes to capture the responses from the interviewees. After that 
                                our team gathered together to read and reread all of the data from our own notes. Each of us also contributed to the notes based on our own travel experiences. We then annotated our data with 
                                codes by creating a post-it for each of the codes. With the (orange) post-its, we created an <i>affinity diagram</i> by placing one created
                                on the surface at a time, ad rearranging the cards as clusters of similar cards form.
                                Having identified 6 major themes of clusters:
                                <b>"Bias", "Accessibility and Barriers to Travel", "Communication", "Local Perspective", "Overtourism" and "Comfort and Connectedness"</b>
                                we gave each cluster a descriptive label (blue post-its). Finally, we combined the labels and 
                                created categories of categories that indicate the most common problems experiened by the travelers.

                            <p> Of all of the labelled notes, we selected several interesting and representative post-its to deduce an interaction design requirement for each post-it. 
                                Following this, we carried out an iterative, fast-moving collaborative process for forming design ideas, in which we switched between idea creation and critiquing.
                                Every team member expressed preliminary design ideas and concepts by creating freehand drawings until we had gathered enough ideas.  Then, every team member proceeded to review and judge all of the generated ideas 
                                on the excel sheet based on <i> desirable </i>,<i>viable</i>, and <i>feasible</i>. The items that received the highest overall score
                                were then brought to the table for more spcific idea refinement. We iterated this process until we all believed our ideas had been refined. </p>

                                We built an app that helps travelers build an itinerary in a way that 
                                pushes them outside their comfort zone while balancing aspects of growth such as history, local life, arts, and interaction.

                                It will understand the user by pulling profile information from Google
                                –similar to how Google create relevant advertisements based on your activities and interactions over the internet – 
                                and learn their level of comfort for different activities as they accept and reject proposed activities. 
                                The red number at the top right of the picture indicates the stretch level of the proposed activity (1 being most comfortable, that is activities that most closely align with what the user normally
                                do in their own country; and 5 being the most stretch, that is activities that are furthest from the user's comfort zone).
                                The app will be biased towards pushing users into their stretch zone.

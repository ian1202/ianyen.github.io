                            <h2>The problem</h2>
                                <p> According to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, men died by suicide at a rate of 3.54 percent higher than women in 2017.
                                    Depression and suicide are ranked as a leading cause of death among men, and yet they’re still far less likely to seek mental health treatment than women.
                                    In our society, a lot of men don’t want to admit they have this problem. They still see depression as a sign of weakness.
                                    There are still some outdated stereotypes as a man suffering from depression; men as a source of Strength, dominating positions of power, the hunter-gatherer, 
                                    the idea that strong and silent is alluring/attractive, the "show no weakness" bravado of heroes in our media.
                                    However, this type of thinking is outdated, a relic of previous generations that doesn’t speak to the current medical understanding of mental illness.
                                    Depression, anxiety, personality disorders and schizophrenia are no more or less difficult based on whether someone has a Y chromosome in their DNA. Hence, 
                                    there has never been a better time to leverage advanced technologies 
                                    to create a safe space that allows men to seek – and be accepted for – help with their mental wellbeing.

                            <p> Men's Talk is an encrypted mobile application, designed for middle-aged men who do not feel comfortable seeking mental 
                                health services in person to track their symptoms and open up about their struggles with a supportive community and providers without having to 
                                disclose their identity. Men's Talk will help men break through the stigma and obstacles by providing a safe and trusted platform, on 
                                which the user can simply ask questions and get advice. Combined with the biometric data (I.e. heart rate) 
                                collected from the user’s wearable devices, Men's Talk uses natural language processing to perform sentimental analysis of the user’s interactions 
                                and will generate a chart that shows the user's change of mood over a period of time. 
                                The experience can fight the stigma that real men don’t talk about their troubles by allowing them to open up to others.

                                    <h2>Research Methodology </h2>
                                    <p> The main goal of the user research is to understand the users and their experience in relation to mental health struggles in general. I will conduct semi-structured interviews for the
                                        product. The main reasons for choosing semi-structured interviews over contextual inquiry is because mental health struggles are not a concrete one-time event in a predictable setting, 
                                        but instead is a long-lived experience should have come across. There is no specific thing to be observed; nor is there a need to question the participants while they work in a particular environment. 
                                        Hence, detailed questions about user practices, thoughts and experiences with mental health management, through a one-on-one format, would be sufficient to elicit relevant responses from the participants. 
                                        Notes will be taken during and after each interview. Audio recordings will be used to assist data collection with the permission of the participants.

                                        I employ an iterative, user-centered participatory design (UCD) approach to actively involve all stakeholders
                                        in the design process to help ensure the product meets their needs and is usable. In the cyclic process of prototyping, testing, analyzing, and refining the product, 
                                        the stakeholders (users, MH professionals, UX experts) will participate during several stages of an innovation process: during the initial exploration 
                                        and problem definition to help define the problem and to focus ideas for solution, and during development, to help evaluate proposed product prototype.
                                        These phases are informed by Nielsen’s Usability Design Lifecycle.
                                        The result will allow me to make appropriate modifications and confirm design concepts as the prototype matured from wireframe mock-ups into a functional application (low-fi -> mid-fi -> high-fi). 
                                        I will iteratively refine process to determine that I have accurately represented the user stories about mental health struggles.
                                        Nielson's 10 Heuristics evaluation will be conducted of the mid-fi prototype by 2 recruited UX researchers to identify major usability problems in the user interface design.
                                        As the prototype takes sophisticated form and becomes highly functional, I will carry out a Rigorous Evaluation in
                                        a lab setting to measure the quality of the user's experience when interacting with the product, with the focus on learnability, memorability, comprehensibility and subjective satisfaction.

                            <p> I analysed the data by, firstly, annotating the interview notes with codes in the margins. 
                                Secondly, I created a card for each of the code using post-its (yellow). With these self-standing cards, I then put them into corresponding clusters, 
                                and identified 6 common themes labelled (white) as “Anonymity”, “Mental Health Services”, “Emotion Management”, “Communication”, “Friends and Family” and “Support Network” respectively. 
                                Finally, I combined these 6 themes and created 3 high-level categories labelled “Barriers & Stigma”, “Methods” and “Network” (lined paper), which summarize all of the collected data declaratively.                    </p>

                                "Barriers and Stigma" categorizes the participants’ perceived barriers to reaching out to mental health providers, such as insurance reimbursement and intricately confusing process, and the importance of 
                                staying anonymous when using these services. Methods categorizes the means by which the participants manage their emotional swings, including texting with friends, binge eating and exercising. And Network condenses the 
                                formal and informal social support networks that the participants rely on for stress management, such as the fellowship at church.  
                                It was surprising to find out the importance of a single-sex platform for the users when it comes to a mental health support network. To quote one participant, <i style='color: black;' >“I cannot share my deepest struggles relating to my family or marriage with anyone at 
                                church because my wife is part of it too”</i> . Another participant also states, <i style='color: black;'>“there are some issues that only men understand like sexual problems”. </i>

                                Goals: To have a group to be there for him when he is in need of emotional support. He wants to speak about his issues and struggles with people anywhere anytime, especially when he is traveling for work on his own.
                                Tasks: Have a secured and safe community network that allows him to communicate with a group that can understand and relate to his problems.
                                Environment: He is always out of town and on the road. His constant travelling has made it difficult to have a physical and stable support network.

                            <p> Role:Gregory experiences serious anxiety sometimes as he is the only source of income for his parents. He has never sought mental health services because of the stigma around it and financial constraints– 
                                he is enrolled in a basic insurance plan and does not "think" mental health services are covered. High cost and complex procedure of mental health servies prevent him from seeking it. 
                                Goals: He wants to be able to speak with a mental health professional without having to worry about the costs and time. He wants to know whether he is in need of professional services sometimes, and if so, how to 
                                access those services.
                                Tasks: To have access to a mental health providers as well as the most relevant information about the services at a very low cost. 
                                Environment: He does not want anyone to know if he is seeing a mental health professional, as it will create worries and provoke judgement.

                            <p> Nielsen's 10 Heuristics evaluation was independently conducted of the mid-fi prototype by 2 UX researchers. This process specifically involves evaluators

                                in the user interface before it is put into wide use. The violations below were concluded by the researchers:

                                and the “find clinic” and “self help techniques” would allow the user to easily navigate and

                                This is the only screen that isn’t consistent with the rest of the screen design wise - the header is of a different color (a green that 
                                does not appear in any of the other screens) and the structure of the header is also different. This jumps out because the rest of the screens are very consistent.

                                This screen is highly sensitive as very personal information is sent to practically strangers and yet pictures of the people appear here- I think having a quick “unsend” button can be useful for users -

                                When the input inserts details - they should have rich drop down lists for different detail fields of options they can choose from rather than free text. 
                                This will allow the user to recall and think of all their health related issues.

                                <p class="lead"> Having taken the 5 violations identified in the Heuristic evaluation into consideration, I modified the user flow. The "Find a Clinic" and "Chat with a Doctor" functions 
                                    have been combined into one function ("Professional Help") to enhance the clarity of the information architecture, as well as to decrease the cognitive workload of the users. This modification was made following a discussion with the UX evaluators 
                                    who expressed confusion about having to choose between the two functions– as one was uncertain whether their condition would require an in-person visit to the clinic or just a virtual chat with a provider. 
                                    The modified design factors in the information filled out by the user in the "Professional Help" interface, whereby provide a suggestion about the next step.

                                As the prototype iteratively takes a more sophisticated form, I plan on carrying out a rigorous evaluation in the lab to gain valuable information about 
                                the user experience of the product. This will allow me to assess whether my design meets my UX goals by 
                                assessing users' performance in completing a set of key tasks with the prototype. Click the
                                link below to view the rigorous evaluation protocol I have devised.

                                    <h3>Be an interviewer, not a note-taker. </h3> <p> I realised the significance of really paying attention to what the participant is 
                                    saying and exchangeing eye contacts with them throughout the interviews. 
                                    Such gestures made the participants feel more respected, and in turn more comfortable to open up about themselves to me.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Pay attention to every interaction with the participant. </h3> <p>One of the challenges I faced during 
                                        data collection was arranging face-to-face interviews with the participants. 
                                        Most of the participants were reluctant to be interviewed in-person or to be audio recorded. 
                                        While the reasons were not explicitly explored, it may imply the stigma and sensitivity around 
                                        the topic of mental health that should be given further thoughts. </p>    
                                    <h3>Diversity of thoughts. </h3> <p> There are things that can easily slip my mind, hence it is 
                                    always beneficial to ask for the opinions of other designers. With a different education, upbrining,
                                    and character, each designer can bring a different piece of puzzle to the bigger picture. </p>

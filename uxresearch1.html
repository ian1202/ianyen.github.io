                            <h2>Product Concept & Statement </h2>
                            <p> Men's Talk is an encrypted mobile application, designed for middle-aged men who do not feel comfortable seeking mental 
                                health services in person to track their symptoms and open up about their struggles with a supportive community and providers without having to 
                                disclose their identity. With today’s stigma around mental health that stops many men from seeking help, suicide has become one of the leading causes of injury death among men in the USA. 
                                MH will help men break through these obstacles by providing a safe and trusted platform, on which the user can simply ask questions and get advice. Combined with the biometric data (I.e. heart rate) 
                                collected from the user’s wearable devices, MH uses natural language processing to perform sentimental analysis of the user’s interactions and will alert the user if there are any potential symptoms. 
                                The experience is fun and can fight the stigma that real men don’t talk about their troubles.

                                    <h2>Research Methodology </h2>
                                    <p> The main goal of the user research is to understand the users and their experience in relation to mental health struggles in general. Therefore, I will conduct a semi-structured interview for my 
                                        product (“Men's Talk”). The main reasons for choosing semi-structured interviews over contextual inquiry is because mental health struggles are not a concrete one-time event in a predictable setting, 
                                        but instead is a long-lived experience should have come across. There is no specific thing to be observed; nor is there a need to question the participants while they work in a particular environment. 
                                        Hence, detailed questions about user practices, thoughts and experiences with mental health management, through a one-on-one format, would be sufficient to elicit relevant responses from the participants. 
                                        Notes will be taken during and after each interview. Audio recordings will be used to assist data collection with the permission of the participants.

                            <h2>Results </h2>
                            <p> I conducted semi-structured interviews with 3 participants from different industries and of different socioeconomic status, over the phone and in-person. 
                                Two of the participants considered their mental health status to be normal, while one stated he had poor mental health. 
                                All of the participants have had a depression/ anxiety or anger episode in the past 6 months. Only one participant has ever reached out to mental health services; 
                                the other two would share their struggles with their friend(s). The major perceived barriers to MH services include insurance reimbursement and stigma. Though surprisingly, 
                                even all these barriers aside, most of the participants did not think MH providers could help or understand their circumstances mainly due to the impression that a treatment 
                                solely involved medications. All participants agreed that a supporting network that only consists of men to would be allow them to share their MH burden. In addition to anonymity, 
                                time was also highlighted as another important factor when it comes to figuring out an approach to their MH issues.

                            <p> I analyzed the data by, firstly, annotating the interview notes with codes in the margins. 
                                Secondly, I created a card for each of the code using post-its (yellow). With these self-standing cards, I then put them into corresponding clusters, 
                                and identified 6 common themes labelled as “Anonymity”, “Mental Health Services”, “Emotion Management”, “Communication”, “Friends and Family” and “Support Network” respectively (white). 
                                Finally, I combined these 6 themes and created 3 high-level categories labelled “Barriers & Stigma”, “Methods” and “Network” (lined paper), which summarize all of the collected data declaratively.                    </p>

                            <p> 
                                Barriers and Stigma categorizes the participants’ perceived barriers to reaching out to mental health providers, such as insurance reimbursement and intricately confusing process, and the importance of 
                                staying anonymous when using these services. Methods categorizes the methods used by the participants to manage their emotions, including texting with friends, binge eating and exercising. And Network condenses the 
                                formal and informal social support networks that the participants rely on for stress management, such as the fellowship at church.  
                                It was surprising to find out the importance of a single-sex platform for the users when it comes to a mental health support network. To quote one participant, <i>“I cannot share my deepest struggles relating to my family or marriage with anyone at 
                                    church because my wife is part of it too”</i> . Another participant also states, <i>“there are some issues that only men understand like sexual problems”. </i>
                                One of the challenges I faced was arranging face-to-face interviews with the participants. Most of the participants were reluctant to be interviewed in-person or be audio recorded. While the reasons were not explored, it may imply the stigma and sensitivity around the topic of mental health that should be addressed when designing the app.
